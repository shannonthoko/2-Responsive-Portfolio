# 2-Responsive-Portfolio
Homework 2

I have created a portfolio website. 

I have 3 HTML files (index.html,contact.html,) and 1 css file. 

There is a navigation bar that is consistent on every page. I have linked google fonts, bootstrap repsonsive design, and bootstrap stylesheet. 

I have used semantic elements, bootstrap components and bootstrap's grid system.
